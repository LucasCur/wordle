## ðŸ’» Wordle
- A working command-line-interface Wordle clone created once in python and a second time in golang. Uses a basic CLI user interface.
- Please note: The golang version of this project was created on my second day of learning golang, so there's probably a lot I could do more efficiently, etc.

## User Interface

- Key to show what each symbol means
- Counter to show how many tries left and on what try you won or lost
- Section displaying the word tried and what characters are correct / in correct place etc.
